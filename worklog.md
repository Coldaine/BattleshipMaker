# Worklog

## May 27, 2025

- Integrated the initial steps of the 3D model generation framework from `ProposedChange.md` into `src/main.py`.
- Modified `process_single_image` to collect Gemini analysis results for different views of the same ship.
- Added `apply_3d_framework_steps_for_ship` function to handle ship-specific 3D processing steps.
- Implemented the scaling and alignment logic (Step 3) based on transcribed dimensions and hull bounding boxes.
- Added conceptual placeholders for subsequent 3D generation steps (Hull Contour Extraction, Component Primitive Generation, Hull Construction, Assembly, Final Review, Export).

## May 28, 2025

- Implemented the conversion of vectorized hull contours from pixels to meters (part of Step 4) in `apply_3d_framework_steps_for_ship`.
- Began implementing Component Primitive Generation (Step 5) by calculating approximate 3D dimensions and center positions in meters for components based on Gemini's bounding box data and calculated scale factors.

## Next Steps

- **May 29, 2025:** Integrate a 3D geometry library (e.g., Open3D, Trimesh) and use the calculated hull contours and component parameters to generate the 3D hull mesh and component primitive meshes (completing Step 5 and beginning Step 6).
